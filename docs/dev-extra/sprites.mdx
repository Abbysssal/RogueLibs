## Adding sprites as resources {#sprites-as-resources}

First of all, get your sprites and convert them to PNG or JPEG, if they're not already PNG- or JPEG-encoded.

Then, change the files' extensions to `.bin`. This way Visual Studio will recognize the files as binary data instead of bitmaps.

Right-click on your project, go a-a-all the way down and click **Properties**:

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/dev-extra/sprites/project-properties.png')} width='300'/>

Go to **Resources** tab and click on *that* button to create a resources file:

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/dev-extra/sprites/create-resources.png')} width='800'/>

Select **Add resource** at the top of the menu and click **Add existing file...**:

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/dev-extra/sprites/add-resource.png')} width='600'/>

Now just find your images (with `.bin` extension) and add them as resources:

Now you should be able to reference your sprites' data from the code like this: `Properties.Resources.<ResourceName>`.

If you get an error, then make sure that the default namespace, that is specified in project's properties in **Application** tab, is the same as the one you're using.

## Initialization {#initialization}

Normally, new instances of `RogueSprite` are created like this:

```csharp
RogueLibs.CreateCustomItem<MyCustomItem>()
    ...
    // highlight-next-line
    .WithSprite(Properties.Resources.MyCustomItem);
```

But you can create them directly too, although you'll have to specify a name and a scope. Scope of the sprite determines what areas of the game the sprite will be available in. `SpriteScope.Items` will work only on items, `SpriteScope.Objects` - only on objects, and etc. You can specify multiple scopes too by combining them with `|` operator.

```csharp
RogueLibs.CreateCustomSprite("name", SpriteScope.Items, Properties.Resources.ResourceName);
```

This section is being worked on.

By default, RogueLibs uses the entire file as a texture. You can specify the region of the texture used with a `Rect` parameter:

```csharp
RogueLibs.CreateCustom("name", SpriteScope.Items, Properties.Resources.ResourceName,
                                // highlight-next-line
                                new Rect(64f, 64f, 128f, 128f));
```

If you're going to use non-64x64 textures, then you need to specify the PPU (pixels-per-unit) parameter too:

```csharp
RogueLibs.CreateCustom("name", SpriteScope.Items, Properties.Resources.ResourceName,
                                // highlight-next-line
                                new Rect(64f, 64f, 128f, 128f), 128f);
```

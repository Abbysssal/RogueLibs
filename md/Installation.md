### Installing BepInEx (Windows) ###

If you have Windows, you'll need to determine your Windows version, whether it's 32-bit or 64-bit. If you do know your version, then skip the next step.

#### Determining OS version ####

There's a quick way to determine your version:
- If you have **more than 4 Gb of RAM**, then you definitely have a **64-bit OS**. A 32-bit version simply cannot use more than 4 Gb of RAM, because of, you know, 32 bits.

If you have 4 Gb or less, then:

- If you have Windows 10, click [this link](ms-settings:about) (or `⊞ Win`+`I` > **System** > **About**). You'll see what version of Windows you're running under **Device specifications: System type**.
- If you have Windows 7 or 8, then [go here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/which-version-of-windows-operating-system-am-i-running-628bec99-476a-2c13-5296-9dd081cdd808).

#### Downloading ####

[Go here](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/latest) and download the version for your OS:
- `BepInEx_x64_5.x.y.z.zip` - for 64-bit systems,
- `BepInEx_x86_5.x.y.z.zip` - for 32-bit systems.

#### Extracting ####

**Extract the contents of the .zip file into the game's root directory.**

If you don't know where the game's installed, then open Steam's library and right-click on the game and click **Properties**:

Go to **Local files** and click **Browse...**:

Make sure you extract it the right way. There's a lot of wrong ways, apparently.

- Make sure that `BepInEx` folder is extracted in the same directory as your game's executable (StreetsOfRogue.exe);
- Make sure that you extract the files `doorstop_config.ini` and `winhttp.dll` too;

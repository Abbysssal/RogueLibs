## Hooks ##

> Custom items, abilities, traits, effects and unlocks are implemented as hooks. Hooks are attached to their instances using a special field in the instance class, that is patched in with RogueLibsPatcher.
> 
> All hookable instances have these extension methods:
> 
> ```cs
> public THook GetHook<THook>();
> public IEnumerable<THook> GetHooks<THook>();
> public void AddHook(IHook<T> hook);
> public THook AddHook<THook>();
> public void RemoveHook(IHook<T> hook);
> public THook RemoveHook<THook>();
> ```

Custom items, abilities, traits, effects and unlocks implement `IHook<T>` interface. Adding and removing hooks from an instance is done through `HookController<T>` class. RogueLibsPatcher patches fields, called `__RogueLibsHooks`, into the affected classes. These fields then hold instances of `HookController<T>` class, that contain lists of attached hooks.

Then, custom hooks, like `CustomItem`, `CustomTrait`, `CustomEffect` and etc., are attached to these hook controllers like this (`IHook<InvItem>` example):

```cs
public static void InvItem_SetupDetails(InvItem __instance)
{
    // adding hooks that initialize item data (CustomItem.SetupDetails)
    foreach (IHookFactory<InvItem> factory in RogueLibsInternals.InvItemFactories_Init)
        if (factory.CanCreate(__instance))
        {
            IHook<InvItem> hook = factory.CreateHook(__instance);
            __instance.AddHook(hook);
            hook.Initialize();
        }
    // adding other hooks
    foreach (IHookFactory<InvItem> factory in RogueLibsInternals.InvItemFactories)
        if (factory.CanCreate(__instance))
        {
            IHook<InvItem> hook = factory.CreateHook(__instance);
            __instance.AddHook(hook);
            hook.Initialize();
        }
}
```

Hook factories are particularly useful in here, since some hooks can affect more than one single item. `CanCreate` method determines whether a hook from that factory should be attached to that instance. Then, `CreateHook` is called, that creates a new instance of the hook, and the hool is attached to the object.

#### Making Your Own Hooks ####

Implement `IHook<T>` (or `HookBase<T>`) in your class and create a factory class for it:

```cs
public class ElectrifiedItemHook : HookBase<InvItem>
{
    public InvItem MyItem { get => Instance; set => Instance = value; }
    public int Volts { get; set; }
    protected override void Initialize() { }
}
public class ElectrifiedItemHookFactory : HookFactoryBase<InvItem>
{
    public override bool CanCreate(InvItem item)
        => item.Categories.Contains("Electrified");
    public override IHook<InvItem> CreateHook(InvItem item)
        => new ElectrifiedItemHook() { Instance = item, Volts = 3 };
}
```

Then add an instance of that factory to `RogueLibsInternals.InvItemFactories` list:

```cs
ElectrifiedItemHookFactory factory = new ElectrifiedItemHookFactory();
RogueLibsInternals.InvItemFactories.Add(factory);
```

Then you can use that hook in your code:

```cs
// somewhere in the code
ElectrifiedItemHook hook = item.GetHook<ElectrifiedItemHook>();
if (hook != null)
{
    agent.ChangeHealth(-hook.Volts);
    hook.Volts--;
    if (hook.Volts == 0) item.RemoveHook(hook);
}
```

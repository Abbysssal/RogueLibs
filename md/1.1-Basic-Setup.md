## Using RogueLibs in your mod ##

Put RogueLibsCore.dll and RogueLibsCore.xml into your Libraries folder and then add RogueLibsCore.dll into your project, just like any other .dll.

Add `using RogueLibsCore;` to your usings, and then add `BepInDependency` attribute to your plugin class:

```cs
...
using RogueLibsCore;

namespace MyBeautifulMod
{
    [BepInPlugin(...)]
    [BepInDependency(RogueLibs.GUID, "3.0")]
    public class MyBeautifulPlugin : BaseUnityPlugin
    {
        ...
    }
}
```

Well... That's it.

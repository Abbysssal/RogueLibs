## `CustomEffect` ##

Custom status effects are very similar to custom traits.

All custom status effect classes must derive from `CustomEffect` class:

```cs
public class OnFire : CustomEffect
{
    ...
}
```

There are **5** methods that you need to implement:

`OnAdded` and `OnRemoved` are the same as `CustomTrait`'s ones:

```cs
public override void OnAdded() { }
public override void OnRemoved() { }
```

`OnUpdated` method just has a different parameter type:

```cs
public override void OnUpdated(EffectUpdatedArgs e)
{
    if (Owner.HasTrait("Fireproof"))
    {
        CurrentTime = 0;
        return;
    }
    float damage; float delay;
    if (Owner.HasTrait("Flammable")) { damage = 2f; delay = 0.5f; }
    else { damage = 1f; delay = 1f; }

    Owner.deathMethod = "OnFire";
    if (CausedBy != null) Owner.deathKiller = CausedBy.agentName;
    Owner.ChangeHealth(-damage);
    e.UpdateDelay = delay;

    CurrentTime--;
}
```

**As of now, you have to decrement `CurrentTime` yourself.**

`GetEffectTime` gets the effect's default time. `GetEffectHate` gets the effect's default hate factor (usually, it's either 5 or 0).

```cs
public override int GetEffectTime()
{
    if (Owner.HasTrait("Flammable")) return 30;
    else return 10;
}
public override int GetEffectHate() => 5;
```

Both `GetEffectTime` and `GetEffectHate` can be called on an *empty* instance of `CustomEffect`, attached to a non-initialized instance of `StatusEffect`. It's used like this to get the amount of time, that the status effect from a syringe will last for.

`GetEffectTime` can return `9999` (four nines), if you want the effect to last indefinitely.

## `CustomEffect`'s Properties ##

So, here are the properties:

```cs
public StatusEffect Effect { get; } // the current item
public StatusEffects StatusEffects => Effect.GetStatusEffects();
public Agent Owner => Effect.GetStatusEffects().agent;
public Agent CausedBy => Effect.causingAgent;
```

`CurrentTime` is used to get or set the effect's time.

```cs
public int CurrentTime { get => Effect.curTime; set => Effect.curTime = value; }
```

There's an `EffectInfo` property that contains static information about your status effect - its name and information about `IgnoreChecks` attributes:

```cs
public CustomEffectInfo EffectInfo { get; internal set; }
```

And, since `gc` is used basically everywhere and it always refers to one single instance of `GameController` class, you can use this property:

```cs
public static GameController gc => GameController.gameController;
```

## `CustomItem` ##

All custom item classes must derive from `CustomItem` class:

```cs
public class VoodooDoll : CustomItem
{
    ...
}
```

There's one method that you need to implement - `SetupDetails`:

```cs
    public override void SetupDetails()
    {
        Item.itemType = ItemTypes.Tool;
        Item.itemValue = 200;
        Item.initCount = 1;
        Item.rewardCount = 1;
        Item.stackable = true;
        Item.hasCharges = true;
    }
```

This method is called only once, when the item is created or spawned.

By default, your custom item will have the same name as the class (`Type.Name`). You can change that with `ItemNameAttribute`:

```cs
[ItemName("Voodoo_Doll_Item")]
public class VoodooDoll : CustomItem { ... }
```

You can also specify your item's categories with `ItemCategoriesAttribute` (you can add categories in `SetupDetails` too, but it is not recommended):

```cs
[ItemCategories(RogueCategories.Social, RogueCategories.Stealth, RogueCategories.Weird)]
public class VoodooDoll : CustomItem { ... }
```

There's a useful `RogueCategories` class that contains `const string`s for all existing item categories (use it to avoid typos). You can add your own categories too.

#### Item-Specific Variables ####

In RogueLibs v2 you would have to do some stuff with dictionaries, but now you can just declare a field or a property in your item's class:

```cs
public Agent Target { get; set; }
public int Energy = 5;
```

Yeah, it's that easy.

## Initializing Custom Items ##

You can integrate your custom items into the game using this method:

```cs
public static ItemInfo RogueLibs.CreateCustomItem<TItem>();
```

And then you can chain `With_____` methods to set the custom ite's sprite, name, description and unlock:

```cs
RogueLibs.CreateCustomItem<VoodooDoll>()
    .WithSprite(Properties.Resources.VoodooDoll)
    .WithName(new CustomNameInfo("Voodoo Doll"))
    .WithDescription(new CustomNameInfo("Spooky."))
    .WithUnlock();
```

## `CustomItem`'s Properties ##

So, there are a couple of properties that you can use:

```cs
public InvItem Item { get; } // the current item
public InvDatabase Inventory => Item.database; // the item's inventory
public Agent Owner => Item.agent; // the item's owner
```

You can change the item's count by using `Count` property. If you set the count to 0, it automatically destroys the item, so you don't have to worry about "0 of your item" bug:

```cs
public int Count { get; set; }
```

There's an `ItemInfo` property that contains static information about your item - its name, categories and information about `IgnoreChecks` attributes (more on that later):

```cs
public CustomItemInfo ItemInfo { get; internal set; }
```

And, since `gc` is used basically everywhere and it always refers to one single instance of `GameController` class, you can use this property:

```cs
public static GameController gc => GameController.gameController;
```

## `CustomTrait` ##

All custom trait classes must derive from `CustomTrait` class:

```cs
public class Smoker : CustomTrait
{
    ...
}
```

There are three methods that you need to implement:

`OnAdded` is called when the trait is initialized and added to the character. For example, you can increase/decrease character's attributes or set some variables:

```cs
public override void OnAdded()
{
    Owner.SetEndurance(Owner.enduranceStatMod - 1);
    Owner.SetSpeed(Owner.speedStatMod - 1);
}
```

`OnRemoved` is called when the trait is removed from the character. If you increased/decreased character's attributes in `OnAdded`, then you need to decrease/increase them back to what they were before:

```cs
public override void OnRemoved()
{
    Owner.SetEndurance(Owner.enduranceStatMod + 1);
    Owner.SetSpeed(Owner.speedStatMod + 1);
}
```

`OnUpdated` is called as an update. Update frequency is configurable through `TraitUpdatedArgs.UpdateDelay`. You'll need to set it at the beginning of every call (default is 1 second per update):

```cs
public override void OnUpdated(TraitUpdatedArgs e)
{
    e.UpdateDelay = 10f; // next update will be in 10 seconds
    int rnd = new System.Random().Next(0, 3);
    if (rnd == 0)
    {
        rnd = new System.Random().Next(3) + 1;
        Owner.SayDialogue($"Smoker_Cough{rnd}");
        Noise noise = gc.spawnerMain.SpawnNoise(Owner.tr.position, 1f, Owner, "Attract", Owner);
        noise.distraction = true;
        // randomly say one of the dialogues
        // "Smoker_Cough1", "Smoker_Cough2" or "Smoker_Cough3"

        // ... it's a reference to one of the traits in Voice Bastards
    }
}
```

#### Trait-Specific Variables ####

Just like with custom items, you can declare fields and properties in your custom trait's class:

```cs
public int Delay;
public int Level { get; set; } = 1;
```

## Initializing Custom Traits ##

You can integrate your custom traits into the game using this method:

```cs
public static TraitInfo RogueLibs.CreateCustomTrait<TTrait>();
```

And then you can chain `With_____` methods to set the custom trait's name, description, unlock and even a sprite!

```cs
RogueLibs.CreateCustomTrait<Smoker>()
    .WithName(new CustomNameInfo("Smoker"))
    .WithDescription(new CustomNameInfo("You cough randomly, alerting any nearby enemies."))
    .WithUnlock();
```

## `CustomTrait`'s Properties ##

So, here are the properties:

```cs
public Trait Trait { get; } // the current item
public StatusEffects StatusEffects => Trait.GetStatusEffects();
public Agent Owner => Trait.GetStatusEffects().agent;
```

There's a `TraitInfo` property that contains static information about your trait - its name and information about `IgnoreChecks` attributes:

```cs
public CustomTraitInfo TraitInfo { get; internal set; }
```

And, since `gc` is used basically everywhere and it always refers to one single instance of `GameController` class, you can use this property:

```cs
public static GameController gc => GameController.gameController;
```
